# Pot Roast

## Ingredient

* roast (4 - 5 lb)
* salt & black pepper
* 2 Tbsp canola oil or clarified butter
* 1/2 onion (chopped)
* 3 carrots (cut into 2 inch pieces)
* 3 stalks celery (cut into 2 inch pieces)
* 2 cloves garlic (minced)
* 3 cups of stock (vegetable or beef)
* 2 bay leaves (crumpled)
* 2 - 3 sprigs of thyme
* 2 tsp corn starch
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

Note: If using vegetable stock, add two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

Preheat oven to 250 degree Fahrenheit.

Pat roast dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a
dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the roast and sear each
side for 5 - 6 minutes. Remove roast and set aside.

Add the onion, carrots, and celery to the pot and saute until the vegetables
start to brown, 6 - 7 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Use a wooden spoon to scrap up
any fond from the bottom of the pot. Distribute the vegetables evenly along the
bottom of the dutch oven. Return the roast to the pot with any accumulated
juices. The roast should be partially submerged in the braising liquid. Cover
with a tight-fitting lid and roast in the oven for about 3 hours, or until the
roast is fork tender.

Remove the roast from the dutch oven, set aside, and tent loosely with aluminum
foil. Strain the vegetables and herbs from the braising liquid, setting aside
the carrots from the strained herbs. Do not wash or rinse the pot. Return the
braising liquid to the pot over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk
the corn starch and cream together in a small bowl.  Incorporate cream mixture
into the pot and continue to whisk. Simmer over medium heat until reduced and
the gravy has thickened, enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt
and pepper to taste.

Just before serving, use two forks to pull the roast apart. Serve with gravy and
carrots on the side.
